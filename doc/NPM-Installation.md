# NPM

From http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm:

> npm is a NodeJS package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Also, if you use it in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies.

### Installation
```bash
curl -L http://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
```
